<br>Feel free to create an issue on the github site for this fork if you come across problems, with the fork, or this server.
<br>This fork is designed to play exactly the same as standard crawl unless you turn on rc file flags to activate new features. You'll see the rc flags commented out at the end of the default rc file. See the README on github for details.
