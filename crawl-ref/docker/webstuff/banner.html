Welcome to Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup: Spicy edition!
<br>
<br>
Check out the <a href='https://github.com/jeremygurr/crawl_spicy'>github page</a> for details about what's available in this fork. 
<br>Feel free to create an issue on the github site for this fork if you come across problems, with the fork, or this server.
<br>WARNING: Don't change spicy specific options while you have a game in progress, or it may break the load. I'm working on making this more robust, but for now, just don't change it until you are in between games (after your current char has died).
<br>This fork is designed to play exactly the same as standard crawl unless you turn on rc file flags to activate new features. You'll see the rc flags commented out at the end of the default rc file. See the README on github for details.
